# Cline Codebase Overview

## Project Overview

Cline is a VSCode extension that functions as an AI assistant capable of interacting with your development environment. It can create/edit files, execute terminal commands, use the browser, and assist with various development tasks.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

1. **Extension Core (`src/extension.ts`)**
   - Main entry point for the VSCode extension
   - Handles extension activation and command registration
   - Sets up the webview and integrates various services

2. **API Integration (`src/api/`)**
   - Multiple AI provider integrations:
     - Anthropic (`providers/anthropic.ts`)
     - OpenAI (`providers/openai.ts`, `providers/openai-native.ts`)
     - Google Gemini (`providers/gemini.ts`)
     - AWS Bedrock (`providers/bedrock.ts`)
     - Vertex AI (`providers/vertex.ts`)
     - Local models via LM Studio/Ollama (`providers/lmstudio.ts`, `providers/ollama.ts`)
   - Transform utilities for different API formats (`transform/`)

3. **Core Functionality (`src/core/`)**
   - `Cline.ts`: Main class handling core assistant functionality
   - Assistant message handling (`assistant-message/`)
   - System prompts and responses (`prompts/`)
   - Webview provider implementation (`webview/`)

4. **Integrations (`src/integrations/`)**
   - Diagnostics monitoring (`diagnostics/`)
   - Editor integration (`editor/`)
   - Terminal management (`terminal/`)
   - Theme handling (`theme/`)
   - Workspace utilities (`workspace/`)

5. **Services (`src/services/`)**
   - Browser automation (`browser/`)
   - File system operations (`glob/`)
   - Code search capabilities (`ripgrep/`)
   - Syntax parsing (`tree-sitter/`)

6. **Web UI (`webview-ui/`)**
   - React-based user interface
   - Components for chat, settings, and history
   - State management and VSCode integration

## Key Features & Implementation Details

### 1. File Operations

- Diff view generation for code changes
- File system monitoring and workspace management
- Support for various file types and languages

### 2. Terminal Integration
- Command execution and output monitoring
- Background process management
- Shell integration for different operating systems
- Terminal session management

### 3. Browser Automation
- Puppeteer integration for browser control
- Screenshot capture and console log monitoring
- Interactive debugging capabilities
- End-to-end testing support

### 4. Code Analysis
- Tree-sitter integration for syntax parsing
- Support for multiple programming languages
- AST-based code understanding
- Regex-based code search capabilities

## Customization Guide

### 1. Adding New AI Providers
1. Create a new provider file in `src/api/providers/`
2. Implement the provider interface
3. Add transformation logic in `src/api/transform/` if needed
4. Register the provider in the main API integration

### 2. Extending Browser Capabilities
1. Modify `src/services/browser/BrowserSession.ts`
2. Add new browser actions and automation features
3. Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. Update the webview UI to support new features

### 3. Adding Language Support
1. Add language queries in `src/services/tree-sitter/queries/`
2. Implement language-specific parsing in `languageParser.ts`
3. Update the code analysis systems to handle new languages
4. Add syntax highlighting and formatting support

### 4. Enhancing Terminal Features
1. Modify `src/integrations/terminal/`
2. Add new terminal command capabilities
3. Implement additional output parsing features
4. Update the terminal management system

### 5. UI Customization
1. Modify React components in `webview-ui/src/components/`
2. Update themes in `src/integrations/theme/`
3. Add new UI features and interactions
4. Implement additional state management as needed

## Best Practices

1. **Error Handling**
   - Implement comprehensive error catching
   - Provide meaningful error messages
   - Handle edge cases in file operations
   - Manage API failures gracefully

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Minimize API calls
   - Optimize file operations
   - Implement caching where appropriate
   - Handle large files and projects efficiently

3. **Security Considerations**
   - Validate all file operations
   - Sanitize terminal commands
   - Implement proper permission checks
   - Handle sensitive data securely

4. **Code Organization**
   - Follow the established module structure
   - Maintain clear separation of concerns
   - Document complex functionality
   - Write unit tests for new features

## Testing

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Add tests in `src/test/`
   - Cover core functionality
   - Test edge cases
   - Implement integration tests

2. **Extension Testing**
   - Use VSCode's extension testing framework
   - Test in different environments
   - Verify extension activation
   - Test command execution

## Common Development Tasks

1. **Adding New Commands**
   - Register in `package.json`
   - Implement in `extension.ts`
   - Add UI components if needed
   - Update command handling

2. **Implementing New Features**
   - Plan the feature architecture
   - Add necessary API endpoints
   - Implement UI components
   - Add error handling
   - Write tests
   - Update documentation

3. **Debugging**
   - Use VSCode's debugging features
   - Monitor console output
   - Check error logs
   - Use the extension development host
